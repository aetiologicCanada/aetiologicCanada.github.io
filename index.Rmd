## Introduction

"I don't do it for the money, but I do do it for a living." (Street performer)

As physicians your focus is on your patients, and when you submit a bill, it is for work that you did.
Sometimes that work was done under great adversity, sometimes it was in the middle of the night. 
Teleplan's reponse to your claim often is a mysterious "being hold" and some weeks or months later perhaps you will be offered less than you claimed - a process euphemistically called "paid with explanations".  Often, too often, your frustration is interrupted by clinical demands and you take what you were offered, or not. 

EVIDENTLY was created as a physician-focused data science company; our first product is designed to help you understand your Remittance Advice and to organize your response to it.
From there we will provide additional value to help you manage your fee-for-service incomes, as individuals and as clinics. 

Additionally, although we are a "data science" company, we have different values.
Most companies keep your data, mine it so they can sell you, or your patients, for secondary analysis.  
We don't keep your data. You send up encrypted, highly "scrubbed" data, we analyze it, and throw your raw data away.
Each remittance advice is treated as it is new data. 
Our business flourishes only if you trust us and how we manage your billing data. 
We've taken some bold and innovative steps to guarantee our methods. 

Contact us. 
It is time we had a conversation.
